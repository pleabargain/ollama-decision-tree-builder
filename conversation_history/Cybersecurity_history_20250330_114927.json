Specifically, the 2020 Solitaire worm attack on JBS Foods in the US and Canada, which resulted in the temporary shutdown of meat processing facilities across North America. This type of attack highlights the growing threat of \"supply chain attacks,\" where attackers target third-party vendors or suppliers to gain access to a company's systems.\n\nWhat do you think are some key challenges or vulnerabilities that companies face when it comes to protecting their supply chains from cyber threats?"
